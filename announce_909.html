<div class="note">
                Play up to five rounds of Live Shows which get progressively more difficult for great rewards!<br />
<br />
<event details="Details"><br />
- Playing the Challenge Festival<br />
Choose a Course you’d like to play and the first Live Show song will be selected. The song is chosen from a selection of eight songs per round. As you advance through the rounds, the songs get progressively more difficult, as indicated by the number of ★s. The song selection for the Courses and the rounds are mostly different, with some exceptions.<br />
<br />
Course and Difficulty<br />
Beginner: ★1 to ★6 (EASY to NORMAL)<br />
Intermediate: ★4 to ★8 (NORMAL to HARD)<br />
Advanced: ★6 to ★10 (HARD to EXPERT)<br />
Extreme: ★9 to ★11 (EXPERT including Random and Super Hard) <br />
<br />
If you fail to clear a Live Show, you will only receive half of the Event Pts, Gs, and Exp you could have earned from that round (in case of Round 1, you receive none.) You will also lose all Gold, Silver and Bronze rewards you may have earned so far.<br />
<br />
In between rounds, you can leave the Challenge Festival and come back later to continue from where you left off. Your Bonus Effects will also be saved. Alternatively, if you find songs from Round 2 onwards difficult, you can choose to collect your rewards and end the Challenge Festival.<br />
<br />
- Bonus Effects<br />
After the song is selected, you may receive up to three Bonus Effects represented by some club members. You may also receive additional bonuses depending on the combination of Bonus Effect members you receive. You are more likely to receive these Bonus Effects as you advance through the Rounds.<br />
<br />
- Team Selection<br />
You can select the team you want to use before each round.<br />
<br />
- Special Effects<br />
Use Gs to add Special Effects to your festival, which give you additional bonus effects during the performances. <br />
<br />
- Get the Rewards<br />
You will earn Event Pts, Gs, and Exp, as well as Gold, Silver and Bronze Rewards for successfully finishing a song ans completing a Round. As you advance through the Rounds, you’ll receive more Event Pts, Gs, and Exp, and you are more likely to receive Gold and Silver Rewards. You will receive your rewards after completing Round 5, or you can choose to collect your rewards and end the current festival by tapping “Collect &amp; Exit” in between the rounds.<br />
<br />
- Event Rewards<br />
You may receive event rewards for the total amount of Event Pts. you’ve collected, as well as ranking rewards for your ranking at the end of the event.<br />
<br />
Note<br />
- Challenge Festival songs completed after 8:00 am Wednesday, November 9 UTC will not be eligible for Event Pts. and other rewards may also be forfeit if the game enters maintenance.<br />
<br />
<achievement rewards="Rewards"><br />
SR Maki Nishikino [Happy Easter]<br />
R Satoko Miyama [Teacher]<br />
and more...<br />
<br />
Note<br />
- SR Maki Nishikino [Happy Easter] is being released early for this event, and will be added to Honor Student Scouting, SR/UR Scouting, and SR or above guaranteed Scout 11 Scouting during November. Event released members have lower appearance rates from Scouting.<br />
- Teachers are ideal for Practicing, but can't be added to a Team or be Idolized.<br />
- Ranking rewards will be distributed after the event has finished.<br />
- Songs completed in the Festival counts toward Live Show related Goals. Tallying will take place after each round.<br />
- Goal achievements are counted after a Goal becomes available. If you complete a round and achieve Live Goals (“Perform Live Shows” or “Get Full Combo”) at the same time, any excess over what was required to achieve those Goals will not count towards the next Goal.<br />
- Festival Live Shows are eligible for First Live Bonus.<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoy Challenge Festival on Love Live! School Idol Festival.<br />
