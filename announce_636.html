<div class="note">
                We have updated the app with the maintenance that began on at 1:30 am on Monday, May 16 UTC.<br />
<br />
The details of the update are as follows.<br />
<br />
Goals<br />
The Goals feature has been updated by merging the old Goals and Album Rewards. As with the previous version, the new Goals are completed automatically by meeting the requirements. In addition to regular Goals, there are Goals that trigger other Goals, and Goals that have time limits. Goals and Album Rewards you have already completed and the rewards you have received can be checked by going to the “Cleared” page in the Goals section. The progress you have made with previous Goals and Album Rewards will be automatically transferred to the new Goals. When a song is unlocked by completing a Goal, all three difficulties, Easy, Normal, and Hard, of that song are unlocked at the same time.<br />
<br />
Note<br />
 - Goal requirements starts to count from the time when the Goals become available.<br />
 - Some Hit Songs can be unlocked by completing several different Goals. If you unlock a Hit Song by completing a Goal, the Hit Song that was listed on other Goals will be replaced with another Hit Song.<br />
 - Most rewards, apart from Titles and Wallpapers, are sent to your Present Box.<br />
 - If a Goal requirement specifies a certain team, you must include all members of that unit.<br />
<br />
Titles<br />
Titles can be earned by completing certain Goals. You can select a Title from your collection and set it to your Profile. To view and set a Title, tap the Title you currently have on the top left corner of the Home screen, or go to Other, then Titles. “Otonokizaka” is set as a default Title.<br />
<br />
Wallpapers<br />
Wallpapers can be earned by completing certain Goals. You can select a wallpaper from your collection and set it as the background of the Home screen. To view and set your Wallpaper, go to Other, then Wallpapers. You will automatically receive some Wallpapers if you have already achieved the requirements before the update.<br />
<br />
Stickers<br />
You will now receive Stickers when you Remove or Practice with an R or above member: one Sticker for non-Idolized members, and two Stickers for Idolized members. There are three types of Stickers: Normal Stickers for R, Super Stickers for SR, and Ultra Stickers for UR. These Stickers can be exchanged for special members and items at the Sticker Shop.<br />
<br />
Note<br />
 - Special Practice does not give out Stickers.<br />
 - The following special members will not give out Stickers:<br />
                 Serial Code members<br />
                 Sticker Shop members<br />
                 Login Bonus members<br />
                 Teachers, Alpacas, and Supporting members<br />
<br />
Sticker Shop<br />
Here you can exchange Stickers for special members and items, including some Serial Code members, UR members currently not in the Honor Student Scouting due to monthly lineup revisions, and Scouting Coupons. Some members and items in the Sticker Shop may have restrictions on how many times you can exchange them or have a specific availability period.<br />
<br />
Note<br />
 - N rarity members do not give out Stickers.<br />
 - Available members and items may change periodically.<br />
 - Members who are Removed or used as a Practice Partner will disappear and can’t be returned.<br />
 - If you have removed members or practiced with eligible members between 15 February 2016 and this update, we have sent you the Stickers you would have received with this change.<br />
<br />
Home screen UI updates<br />
The overall look has changed, but one major change is the “What’s New” laptop icon. Tap the icon to access the latest notifications and updates.<br />
You can also see your Title in the top left corner of the screen.<br />
<br />
LP recovery functionality change<br />
It is now possible to recover LP beyond your current max LP when you Rank Up or use Love Gems.<br />
<br />
Example 1<br />
When a Rank 51 player (max LP 50) with 10 LP left uses a Love Gem, the player will receive 60 LP (recover 50 + current 10).<br />
<br />
Example 2<br />
When a Rank 51 player (max LP 50) with 10 LP left Ranks Up to Rank 52 (max LP 51), the player will receive 61 LP (recover 51 + current 10).<br />
<br />
Other changes<br />
 - Live Shows can be played even if players have the maximum number of Club Members.<br />
 - Sent massages history can now be viewed.<br />
 - Data for stories and Live songs can now be batch downloaded.<br />
 - Other small fixes and adjustments.<br />
<br />
We hope you like the changes and continue to enjoy Love Live! School Idol Festival.<br />
